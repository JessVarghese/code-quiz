# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this application is to challenge a user with a timed quiz based on javascript questions.

Once the user hits start they will be prompted with a series of five questions as a timer decreases in seconds. If the user selects a correct answer, 5 seconds will be added to timer, otherwise incorrect answers will decrease their time by 10 seconds. The game is over once the timer has reached 0.

Once the game is over they can save their score along with their initials to compare their progress with other users.
